 * it takes up where it interrupted its work. Each invocation should complete in a period of time short
 * enough to not cause a significant delay to the UI. After the last run of the loop, the callback
 * removes its event.
 *
 * This can be seen as a lightweight alternative to multithreading. It is available even on platforms
 * without multithreading support, and synchronization is easier as the idle callback has full control
 * over when it yields to other tasks, and can ensure all data is in a consistent state before doing so.
 * However, idle events not suited to all tasks, and poorly written callbacks can cause the UI to become
 * unresponsive. As they un on the main thread, they cannot benefit from multi-processor systems.
